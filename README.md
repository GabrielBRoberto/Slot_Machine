# Slot_Machine

Slot machine made by with python.
You can enter your initial balance, the amount of lines do you want to bet and the amount you want to bet
  1 lines = top line
  2 lines = top and middle lines
  3 lines = top, middle and bottom lines (all lines)
This is a pretty basic code that I made while learning python
